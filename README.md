# Invoice Generator Website

This is a simple invoice generator built with **React.js**. It allows users to create and download invoices as PDF files. The application leverages **local storage** to store invoice data for easy management. This project was created for **practice purposes** as part of my journey to learn **React.js**.

## Features

- **Invoice Generation**: Create invoices by adding customer details, itemized products/services, and total amounts.
- **Download as PDF**: Users can download their generated invoices as PDF files quickly.
- **Local Storage**: Invoice data is stored in local storage, enabling users to view and manage invoices even after page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Local Storage**: Used to persist invoice data in the browser.
- **JavaScript and TypeScript**: For handling logic and data manipulation.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the application.

## Usage

1. Fill out the customer and product/service details in the invoice form.
2. Add multiple items to the invoice as needed.
3. Generate the invoice by clicking the "Generate PDF" button.
4. Download the invoice as a PDF file.

## Purpose

This project was built as part of my learning process with **React.js**. I aimed to gain hands-on experience with managing state, handling local storage, and providing a fast and responsive user interface. The invoice generator project helped me improve my understanding of **React components**, **state management**, and **file handling**.

## Future Improvements

- Add authentication for user accounts.
- Allow users to edit and delete invoices.
- Improve UI/UX design with more customization options.
- Add additional export options (e.g., Excel, CSV).
